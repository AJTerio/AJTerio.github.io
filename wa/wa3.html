    <h3>
        Guts
    </h3>
    <a href = "../img/guts.jpg"><img src = "../img/guts.jpg"/></a>
    <p>
        Guts, the renowned "Black Swordsman," is the main protagonist of this story, and he probably has one of the edgiest back stories of 
        any character ever written. Guts was born from the womb of his deceased mother who was hung from a tree. He was left in a pool 
        of blood and filth to die alone. Sometime after, a band of mercenaries, led by one Gambino, happens upon Guts. Gambino believes 
        Guts is dead before Guts begins crying. Immediately a woman named Shisu takes to him, despite his birth being considered ominous 
        by her allies. Three years later, Shisu contracts the plague and dies as Guts watches, helplessly. Afterward, Guts and Gambino 
        develop a relationship that sees Guts begin honing his swordsmanship skills at a very early age, officially joining the mercenary 
        band at just nine years old. Gambino secretly blames Guts for Shisu's death, and all the bad fortunes he and the mercenaries deal
        with (including when Gambino lost his leg in one of the battles), and one night, Gambino attempts to kill Guts in a drunken rage. 
        Guts is then forced to kill Gambino in self-defense, and is then promptly chased out of the mercenary band. Guts then wanders the
        world alone, and eventually meets Griffith, the leader of the Band of the Hawk, and the two become fast friends. 
        <br>
        I won't delve into the rest of Guts' story for spoiler reasons, and also because in my opinion, experiencing the emotions and events that he goes 
        through is a much better way to truly appreicate and understand his dynamic and standoffish personality. 
        Guts is a very complex character, and his story is one of the most tragic in all of fiction. Miura has done a fantastic job of creating
        scenarios and problems for Guts to overcome that aren't just the classic trope "oh no, I'm in a fight, I better win."
    <h3>
        Griffith
    </h3>
    <a href = "../img/griffith.jpg"><img src = "../img/griffith.jpg"/></a>
    <p>
        Griffith, the leader of the Band of the Hawk. 
        We rarely see Griffith's true self, as he is always wearing a sort of mask that hides his true emotions. Griffith is an extremely
        driven and passionate character who believes heavily in the dreams of people. He is a very calm and composed individual, and knows
        that it takes more than just brute force to achieve his goals. He is a very charismatic leader, and is able to rally his troops
        to follow him to the ends of the earth.
